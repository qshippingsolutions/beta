					<h1>SOLUTIONS</h1>
					<p>Leaders in the maritime industry recognize recurring, high-level problems in their operations. However, they struggle to design innovative solutions because mathematical modeling is not part of their core business. Similarly, most IT consultants for the maritime industry lack modeling expertise and merely provide off-the-shelf solutions for broader applications. 
					<br><br>Our solutions are truly tailored to our client’s problems as well as to their operating methods and fleet size.
					<br><br>Our consulting services help clients frame their problems, determine whether the problems are solvable through modeling, and using our algorithms, outline potential solutions. Once we choose a strategy, we provide a customized software product to allow the client to implement the operational steps.</p>

					<p><b>For tanker shipping clients:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Prior to making a fixture, how do you choose the trading region for the ship, such as AG, WAF, CARIB or UK/CONT? Do you consider only the ballasting distance and charter hire of a given cargo? Or do you also consider the supply and demand situation of the region? Is port condition - congestion or strike - a consideration?</li>
						<li>Do you rely solely on brokers for cargo information? Or do you have latest statistics for cargo at each port or on each route? Do you use such probability when you direct your ships to the next loading port?</li>
						<li>Do you factor potential follow-on cargo into your decision on the current charter?</li>
						<li>Do you price your charter based on the supply and demand condition of the loading port or of the route?</li>
						<li>On what basis do you distribute your ships over different regions? Do you have an optimal distribution tool based on supply and demand of the regions?</li>
						<li>Can you forecast the profit of your fleet based on different chartering policies?</li>
						<li>Are you outperforming the market? How do you measure your performance against the benchmark, if there is any?</li>

						<li>Is your empty box repositioning and inventory management optimal? Is your policy updated periodically based on the market situation?</li>
